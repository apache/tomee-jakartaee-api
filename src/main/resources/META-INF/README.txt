These are the archives used to create the Apache TomEE jakartaee-api-9.0-x.jar.

This archive exists as a way to replace the single jakartaee-api-9.0-x.jar for users
who would rather have the individual API jars rather than one large
jar.  This can be useful in situations where one or more spec versions
need to be upgraded or changed.

Simply delete the jakartaee-api-9.0-x.jar and unzip this zip in its
place. Typically, this will be inside the 'lib' directory of the
TomEE Standalone server or TomEE Webapp.
